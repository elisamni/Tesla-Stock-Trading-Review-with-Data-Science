# Data Science Project

## Tesla Stock Trading Review with Data Science

In this project, I undertook several key tasks and developed various skills:

### 1. Data Collection

I utilized APIs and web scraping techniques to gather data on Tesla's stock prices and financial performance. This helped me enhance my skills in data acquisition.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

I cleaned and transformed the data to prepare it for analysis. This involved handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new variables.

### 3. Data Analysis

I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends and patterns. This included visualizing data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, which improved my data interpretation skills.

### 4. Modeling

I developed models to forecast stock prices and evaluate factors affecting the company's performance. This involved using linear regression and other machine learning algorithms, enhancing my modeling skills.

### 5. Result Visualization

I created graphs and charts to present my findings, making it easier to interpret the results and communicate insights effectively.

### 6. Documenting the Process

I used Jupyter Notebook to document my work, which is essential for reporting and presenting results.

## Skills Gained
