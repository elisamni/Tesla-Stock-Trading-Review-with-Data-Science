# Data-Science-Projects
In my project, "Tesla Stock Trading Review with Data Science," I undertook several key tasks and developed various skills:

Data Collection: I utilized APIs and web scraping techniques to gather data on Tesla's stock prices and financial performance. This helped me enhance my skills in data acquisition.
Data Preprocessing: I cleaned and transformed the data to prepare it for analysis. This involved handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new variables.
Data Analysis: I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends and patterns. This included visualizing data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, which improved my data interpretation skills.
Modeling: I developed models to forecast stock prices and evaluate factors affecting the company's performance. This involved using linear regression and other machine learning algorithms, enhancing my modeling skills.
Result Visualization: I created graphs and charts to present my findings, making it easier to interpret the results and communicate insights effectively.
Documenting the Process: I used Jupyter Notebook to document my work, which is essential for reporting and presenting results.
As a result, I gained skills in Python, data analysis, machine learning, and visualization, which will be valuable in both my professional endeavors and future projects!
